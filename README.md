# Research into Android Canvas API based on: [Karpenko, Y. (2013). Android 2D Graphics with Canvas API.](http://www.amazon.com/Android-2D-Graphics-Canvas-API-ebook/dp/B00DKIAVK8)

Android SDK provides two powerful graphics libraries: OpenGL ES and Canvas API. This book is intended for programmers interested in learning Canvas API. Canvas API is an advanced two-dimensional graphics library. It provides methods for drawing text, lines, rectangles, circles and other graphics primitives.

In this book we will show how to use different graphics primitives, explain basics of coordinate systems and transformations, discuss two common approaches to writing multithreaded graphics applications, and provide a lot of examples.
